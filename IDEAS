 price_as_of($date, $ycurve) ?
 txn_history() ? <-- should be elsewhere

YieldCurve
 --> points sorted ArrayRef[ {duration => $num_days, yield=> $num} ]

CashFlow
 --> has date => DateTime
 --> has amount => 'number'

CashFlowStream -> has ArrayRef[CashFlow]
Annuity isa CashFlowStream

Bond has
 --> Principal
 --> Coupon
 --> IssueDate
 --> MaturityDate
 --> CouponDates (ArrayRef DateTime)
price_as_of($date, $yield_curve);

FixedInterestAmortizingLoan has
 --> Principal
 --> Annual Interest Rate (APR probs)
 --> Periods
 --> Previous Payments [date, payment]
 --> DateOriginated
 --> CashFlowStream (Ammortizing payments)
     --> derived from Periods, Principal, Interest Rate
 -- CHECK at BUILD time to make sure they all match if all given


FixedRateNonAmortizingLoan
 --> has rate
 --> has 'cashflows'
 --> balance_as_of()
 --> adb( $beginning, $end )
 --> interest_expense_for_period( $beginning, $end)

Revolving Line Of Credit is FixedRateNonAmortizingLoan
 --> added back interval? (when is interest capitalized?)
 --> compound interval
 --> 'grace_period' <-- maybe should be variable?


VariableRateLoan ?
 --> formula that implements rate?

Revolver is VariableRateLoan
